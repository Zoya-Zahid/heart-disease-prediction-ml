Heart Disease Prediction  
Developed By: Zoya Zahid

This project builds a logistic regression model to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease, using real-world medical data and standard evaluation metrics.

 ðŸŽ¯ Task Objective
To develop a binary classification model using logistic regression that predicts heart disease based on patient health attributes.

Key Results and Findings
- Model achieved ~85% accuracy (depending on random state)
- **Top predictive features:`cp`, `thal`, `ca`, `exang`
- No missing data found in the dataset
- ROC curve showed a strong area under the curve (AUC â‰ˆ 0.88), indicating reliable performance
